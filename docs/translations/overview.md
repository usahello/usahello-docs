# Overview

The USAHello website handles translations using the WPML plugin. We have a license that is renewed annually. There are two types of translations that are handled on the website:

1. [String translations](string-translations.md)
2. Content translations

Currently, we handle our Arabic and Spanish translations internally and send our other language content to Clear Global to have translated by their network of translators.
